### Helper script to add eyes to standard sprites

Standard means 72x164 regular inserters, 100x164 (closed) and 130x164 (open) stack inserters, 102x240 remnants (3 in 1, as vanilla regular inserter). Only for high-resolution sprites!

Requires Python 3 and `PIL`. Copy `*hand-open*`, `*hand-closed*`, `*remnants*` pics to the folder and run the script.
